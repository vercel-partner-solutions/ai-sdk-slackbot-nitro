This is a Slack Agent template built with Bolt for JavaScript (TypeScript) and the Nitro server framework.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js 22+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Slack workspace** - You need a workspace where you have permission to install apps
  - Create a new workspace [here](https://slack.com/create)
  - Or use a Slack developer sandbox [here](https://api.slack.com/developer-program)
- **Slack CLI** - [Installation guide](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-mac-and-linux)
- **ngrok** - [Download here](https://ngrok.com/downloads)

## Installation
#### Clone and initialize Slack App
   ```bash
   slack create --template https://github.com/vercel-partner-solutions/slack-agent-template.git
   ```

#### (Optional): Use the configure command to access a guided setup in your terminal
```
pnpm configure
```
_This command is still a work in progress. We're working with the Slack team to include this in the Slack CLI for Bolt_

#### Create a Slack App

1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and choose "From an app manifest"
2. Choose the workspace you want to install the application to
3. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click _Next_
4. Review the configuration and click _Create_
5. From the _Basic Information_ tab, copy your _Slack Signing Secret_ into your `.env` file under `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
6. Open the _Install App_ tab on the left menu. Click _Install to <Workspace_Name>_ and _Allow_ on the screen that follows
7. On the following screen, copy the _Bot User OAuth Token_ into your `.env` file under `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

#### Environment Setup
1. Add your `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` to your `.env` file. You can get one [here](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys%3Futm_source%3Dai_gateway_landing_page&title=Get+an+API+Key)
2. _(Optional)_ You can also use your `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN ` to authenticate with the Vercel AI Gateway. More info [here](https://vercel.com/docs/oidc#in-local-development)

#### Prepare for Local Development

1. In the terminal run `slack app link`
2. Select your Slack team in the terminal
3. Copy your App ID from the app you just created
4. Select `Local` when prompted
1. Open your [`config.json`](./.slack/config.json) file under `/.slack/config.json` and update your manifest source to `local`
```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "source": "local"
  },
  "project_id": "<project-id-added-by-slack-cli>"
}
```
1. Start your local server with automatic tunneling using the `pnpm dev:tunnel` command. You can also use the generic `slack run` command if you do not want automatic tunneling and manifest updates. If prompted, select the workspace you'd like to grant access to. Select `yes` when asked _Update app settings with changes to the local manifest?_

2. Open your Slack workspace and add your new Slack Agent to a channel. Your Slack Agent should respond whenever it's tagged in a message or sent a DM

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Create a new Vercel project [here](https://www.vercel.com/new) or select _Add new..._ and _project_ from the Vercel dashboard
2. On the next screen, select *Import* next to your app repository but do *not* click _Deploy_
3. Create a new Slack app for Production. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and choose "From an app manifest"
4. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click _Next_ and _Create_
5. From the _Basic Information_ tab, copy your _Slack Signing Secret_ into the Environment Variables dropdown on your new Vercel project window as `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
6. On your Slack app window, open the _Install App_ tab on the left menu. Click _Install to <Workspace_Name>_ and _Allow_ on the screen that follows. Copy the _Bot User OAuth Token_
7. Open your new Vercel project window and paste this value as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in the environment variables dropdown
8. Click _Deploy_
9. Once the deployment is complete, click _Continue to Dashboard_
10. Copy your production domain URL, seen under  _Domains_ on the _Overview_ tab
11. Open your Slack app settings and click _App Manifest_
12. Update the _url_ and _request_url_ fields of your App Manifest to the production domain. Make sure the `/api/events` path is preserved
13. At the top of the page, you will be prompted to verify the new URL
14. Your production app is now deployed and ready

## Project Structure

### [`manifest.json`](./manifest.json)

[`manifest.json`](./manifest.json) is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### [`/server/app.ts`](./server/app.ts)

[`/app.ts`](./server/app.ts) is the entry point of the application. This file is kept minimal and primarily serves to route inbound requests.

### [`/server/listeners`](./server/listeners)

Every incoming request is routed to a "listener". Inside this directory, we group each listener based on the Slack Platform feature used, so [`/listeners/shortcuts`](./server/listeners/shortcuts/index.ts) handles incoming [Shortcuts](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts) requests, [`/listeners/views`](./server/listeners/views/index.ts) handles [View submissions](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/views#view_submission) and so on.

### [`/server`](./server)

This is your nitro server directory. Inside you have an [`api`](./server/api) folder that contains a [`events.post.ts`](./server/api/events.post.ts) file. This matches the request URL's defined in your [`manifest.json`](./manifest.json) file. Nitro uses file based routing for incoming requests. You can learn more about this [here](https://nitro.build/guide/routing).
